                        Since version 9.0 of the Yoast SEO extension, the prominent words on a page are being analyzed which are used for Insights and linking suggestions.<br>
                        When you visit a page in the backend, this data is being analyzed automatically.<br>
                        This crawler has been introduced to make your life easier and scan every site, page and language and update the needed data.

                        <strong>WARNING:</strong> For every page there are 2 requests being made: one for getting the page data, and one for saving the analysis.<br>
                        On top of that, there is a request for getting the pages to analyze, 50 at a time.<br>
                        Make sure your server is able to handle this and that this does not cause problems with your hosting provider.
