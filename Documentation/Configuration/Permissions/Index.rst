Permissions
===========

Access rights
-------------
Since version 2 of Yoast SEO for TYPO3, you can set permissions by setting the permissions to fields and backend modules
in the backend group permissions. All fields are exclude fields and all modules can be turned on or of separately.
You don't need specific configuration anymore.
