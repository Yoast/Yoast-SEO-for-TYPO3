We will follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Yoast SEO Premium for TYPO3
Besides the free version of our plugin, we also have a premium version. The free version enables you to do all necessary optimizations. With the premium version, we make it even easier to do! More information can be found on https://www.maxserv.com/yoast.

## 7.0.3 September 21, 2020
### Fixed
* Make sure the path to the backend CSS is always available to show a modal. This should fix the problem of a not being able to edit a content element after updating to 7.0.2

## 7.0.2 September 19, 2020
### Fixed
* Removed hardcoded links to typo3conf/ext folder
* Fixed fontsize of text width measurement to ensure we get same calculations as in the WordPress plugin of Yoast SEO

## 7.0.1 September 7, 2020
### Changed
* Added a placeholder to seo_title field to show the user what the value will be if no specific SEO title is set
* Removed negative margin to avoid issues with other plugins
* Updated dependencies

### Fixed
* When changing tabs in the page properties, tje preview keeps working

## 7.0.0 August 10, 2020
### Breaking changes
* We removed the possibility to set the doktypes that needs to be analysed from within TypoScript. The doktypes are needed during the TCA setup and by using TypoScript some installations did crash when no database connection was already in place. The feature was never documented but it was possible so this is marked as a breaking change. Please set your allowed doktypes in your ext_localconf.php as described in the [documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/p/yoast-seo-for-typo3/yoast_seo/6.0/en-us/Configuration/SnippetPreview/Index.html#enable-snippet-preview-on-specific-page-types).  

### Added
* A [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) setup is now included in the repository to make it easy to contribute to this project and check the results in TYPO3 v8, 9 and 10. We added some information in the documentation as well. 
* To be able to alter the URL that should be analysed, we introduced a hook after the link is generated. With this hook, you have the possibility to add your own logic to determine which URL to analyse. More information can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/p/yoast-seo-for-typo3/yoast_seo/6.0/en-us/).

### Changed
* There was a library included which was not used anymore so we removed the dependency to the nimut/testing-framework package.
* Moved from Travis to GitHub actions for the CI process

### Fixed
* Removed include of empty TypoScript file which caused errors in TypoScript Object Manager when installed in non-composer-mode. 
* Add missing return true to executeUpdate function in CanonicalFieldUpdate.php.
* The canonical and title fields are now rendered correctly in frontend again in TYPO3 v8
* Removed wrong information about usage of EXT:realurl in the documentation
* Fixed issue in output of structured data that caused warnings when more inline javascript was added to the frontend.
* The canonical link in TYPO3 v8 is now checking the right GET parameters while building the canonical 

## 6.0.1 April 22, 2020
### Fixed
* We fixed the error in the Upgrade Wizard in CMS 9 and 10.

## 6.0.0 April 21, 2020
### Added
* You can use Yoast SEO now with TYPO3 v10 LTS. We did the update without losing support for TYPO3 v8. So this update is available for TYPO3 v8, v9 and v10.
* Added word form support for Dutch (Yoast library)
* Added the transition word assessment for Hungarian (Yoast library)

### Changed
* Updated Snippet Preview layout (Yoast library)

## 5.1.0 September 20, 2019
### Added
* Visually updated snippet preview to match latest changes on Google.
* Favicons visible in mobile snippet preview
* Added proper error message when server is not able to access the page it wants to analyse.

### Changed
* You can set the doktypes that Yoast should analyse now by `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['yoast_seo']['allowedDoktypes']` in stead of TypoScript. It will still have a fallback to the old TypoScript configuration. ([#283](https://github.com/Yoast/Yoast-SEO-for-TYPO3/issues/283))
* Altered the [documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/p/yoast-seo-for-typo3/yoast_seo/master/en-us/) a little bit.

### Fixed
* Restored the compatibility with PHP 7.0 ([#266](https://github.com/Yoast/Yoast-SEO-for-TYPO3/issues/266))
* Prevent caching of page when analysing a page that is disabled. ([#272](https://github.com/Yoast/Yoast-SEO-for-TYPO3/issues/272))
* When the base in site configuration is only `/`, the absolute URL (which is needed by the analysis) will now be based on the current domain. [#279](https://github.com/Yoast/Yoast-SEO-for-TYPO3/issues/279)
* Made sure that if you set the allowed doktypes via `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['yoast_seo']['allowedDoktypes']`, the doktypes will always be available when defining which fields in the page properties.  ([#283](https://github.com/Yoast/Yoast-SEO-for-TYPO3/issues/283))
* The right URL to analyse the content is now generated when you have a multi-site setup

## 5.0.1 May 2, 2019
### Changed
* Updated Yoast libraries
* Added configuration to exclude certain doktypes in the structured data output for breadcrumbs

### Fixed
* Fixed problems with overview module in CMS8
* Made sure the extension also works with PHP 7.0
* Resolved problems with the upgrade wizard in CMS8

## 5.0.0 April 12, 2019
### Added
* Basic schema.org integration helping you to give structured data to search engines. In this basic version, we will help you with your breadcrumbs and your general site information.
* Possibility for extension developers to create their own schema.org data providers
* Focus keyword is now renamed to Focus keyphrase. You can find more information about the difference on https://yoast.com/difference-between-keyword-and-keyphrase/
* All latest features now available for TYPO3 CMS v8LTS and v9LTS
* New single H1 assessment to check if only one H1 is used within the text

### Changed
* For various languages, we’ll now filter out function words that precede the keyphrase in the title when analysing your title. This means that if you use words like [the], [on] or [what] before your keyphrase in the title, it won’t affect your score.
* The keyword density assessment now takes the length of the focus keyphrase into account, because it can be much harder to use a longer keyphrase in your text. In this new version, you’ll need to use your longer keyphrase less often in the text than a shorter keyphrase to get a green bullet.
* When you have no outbound links on your page, you will get a red bullet instead of an orange one.
* Check if your keyphrase is used in the alt attributes of your images.
* All the technology behind the integration is rewritten so we are future proof and can handle new updates of the Yoast SEO libraries.

### Fixed
* Fixed problem with analysing pages when using a quote in your focus keyword
* When you have larger pages to analyse it could happen in previous versions that your browser crashed. Because we have rewritten the technology to analyse your content, your browser should not crash on large amounts of content anymore.
