#Filing issues

__Please Note:__ GitHub is for bug reports and code contributions only - if you have a support question or a request for a customisation don't post here, go to our [Support Forum](http://support.maxserv.com) instead.

## How to write a useful bug report
If you think you have found a bug (we acknowledge that that's a possibility), please make sure you're using the latest version of the plugin. If possible check out the latest version from GitHub and see if the bug still exists there.

A useful bug report explains:

1. What you were trying to achieve.
2. What you were expecting to happen.
3. What actually happened, illustrated with screenshots if possible.

Your bug report should also contain your TYPO3 version and if there are any errors, the _exact_ error text, including line numbers.

### Blank / white screen
If you're getting a blank screen and you report just that, we can do _absolutely_ nothing. By default, your TYPO3 install suppresses all errors, to prevent information leaks, but we need those errors to be able to help you. You can find those errors in your PHP errorlog. You can ask your webhosting-partner to get those logs.

That error will help us, without that error, we're completely in the dark about your white page problem...

### Interface errors
If you're reporting a bug about specific interface elements not working as expected, there's probably an error showing in your browsers JavaScript console. Please open your browsers console and copy the exact error showing there, or make a screenshot. If you don't know how to open your browsers console, here is info for [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console) and [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Tools/Web_Console). For IE, some Googling will help but it changes with every version.
